## Hi!, my name is Unnati Gupta.

- Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering from Government College of Engineering, Nagpur. 
- I am driven by a constant thirst for knowledge and a commitment to using technology for impactful solutions in the field of Computer Science Engineering.
- In terms of programming languages, I'm proficient in Java and Python. 
- I also have experience and knowledge in C++. I have worked on projects and assignments using C++ and have a solid understanding of its syntax, concepts, and principles. 
- Deep learning using PyTorch is one of my specialties and I have gained valuable experience during my time at ZOHO Corporation. 
- I'm also well-versed in web development technologies like HTML, CSS/SASS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and Django. 
- I have experience with database management using MySQL and version control using Git.
- I'm proud to say that my hard work and skills have been recognized. I won first place at INSITE, a competition organized by COMSA (GCOE, Nagpur), for developing a travel website frontend using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
- To further enhance my knowledge, I have completed certifications like Introduction to Digital Transformation with Google Cloud, Technical Support Fundamentals from Google, and Git and GitHub Bootcamp from Udemy.
- I was a part of the Martian Internship Program, which was a fantastic learning experience. I gained knowledge in important subjects like computer networks, DBMS, data structures and algorithms, operating systems, and programming languages.
- Recently, I had an exciting opportunity to work as a Project Trainee at ZOHO Corporation, where I was part of a Speech Enhancement (R&D) team. During my time there, I created models for image classification, audio classification, and even house price prediction using PyTorch and deep learning techniques.
